--7.Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.

select track,max(energy) from spotify  group by 1 order by 2 desc limit 5;

--8.List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.

select track,
        sum(views) as total_views,
        sum(likes) as total_likes 
		from spotify where official_video='true'
		group by 1
		order by 1,2;
		
--9.For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.

       sum(views) as total_views
	   from spotify 
	   group by 1,2
	   order by 3 desc

--10.Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.

select * from 
(select track ,
coalesce(sum(case when most_playedon='Spotify' then stream end),0) as streamed_on_spotify,
coalesce(sum(case when most_playedon='Youtube' then stream end),0) as streamed_on_youtube
from spotify 
group by 1)as t1
where streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube
and streamed_on_youtube <>0

--11.Find the top 3 most—viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
with most_viewed_tracks as

)
select * from most_viewed_tracks where rank<=3

--12.Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
select track,artist,liveness from spotify where liveness>(select  avg(liveness) from spotify);


--13.Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
 with cte as 
(select album,
       max(energy) as highest_energy,
	   min(energy) as lowest_energy
from spotify
group by 1
)
select album,(highest_energy-lowest_energy)as energy_difference 
from cte order by 2 desc;

--14.Find tracks where the energy—to—liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.

select track,energy/liveness as energy_to_liveness_ratio 
from spotify where energy/liveness>1.2

--15.Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
 select track,views,likes,
 sum(likes)  over (order by views desc)as cum_sum
from spotify
